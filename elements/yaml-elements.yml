notes:  >  
    As referenced from the above yaml file, A YAML file is constructed of a number of different elements.
    Together they can be used to describe a wide variety of structures.
    Like cross language classes, api data structures and deployment instructions for virtual machines and containers.
structure: > 
      YAML elements are mostly based on Key-Value pairs.
      We may see them as strict KV as described in the example below.
examples: 
    example:
        notation: 
            - Name: Value
              example: or a key with a complex/compound value
                     Name: < the key<br />
                        AnotherName: someValue < the value 
property: >  
          YAML is a superset of JSON
          we can utilize JSON style sequences and maps in our constructs
example: 
    - a_json_style_map: {"K": "V"}
    - a_json_style_sequence: ["pink", "red", "red", "cat", 123, 234, 345]
